# Draft Order Picker
## What
The boys demanded a way to pick a draft order in a semi-formal way in the midst of a pandemic.

## How
Right now, its just an array of the names of the gents in the league. Stuff got a little wild in the offseason so there is a catch to make sure one of them is guaranteed a certain pick.

## Why
No draft order selector will be able to handle our league soon.

## How to use
Right now this repo is deployed on Heroku. There is already a Procfile, so it should be pretty easy to clone the repo and point Heroku to your own version. Contact me if you need me to polish this thing up in the future. 

## To-do
Add a button that shows the picks from bottom up, so that when you press the button, it reveals the pick one at a time.
